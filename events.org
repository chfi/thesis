* Events

** Notes
   not *really* a problem in BD, however there is no checking that the features
provided to listeners actually have the data expected by them, leading to a risk
of runtime errors and decreased reusability

would be horrible when working with events from multiple different sources,
e.g. BD and Cy.js -- would end up with a bunch of nestled if-else statements,
searching for non-null properties. and even when you find all the properties
you want, there's no guarantee that

is the BD API also limited in what can be done? well, not really;
I certainly won't be able to do any more than featurelisteners can do
(and only barely in a cleaner/more correct way)
