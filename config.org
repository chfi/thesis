* Config
User configuration is about mapping one-time input from the user
into a set of values that define the initial state of the application.

Clearly, this is something that can fail, and something that must
provide good error messages to the user.

** Foreign
The Foreign type in Purescript signifies any sort of foreign
object whose type cannot be known for certain. This can be
*anything*, including functions.

Decoding Foreign values produces a type in Except, which is
a value-level way of working with exceptions.

** Json
Argonaut's Json type only corresponds to actual JSON, i.e.
things that are legal in JSON formatted files. Thus, functions
and other values that cannot be serialized to JSON, cannot
be represented in the Json type.

On the other hand, Argonaut provides many functions for manipulating
and parsing JSON.
