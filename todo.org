* outline TODO:
** hypothesis
   no stats... eval how?
   metrics, which?
   metrics related to legacy code
   but: metrics don't really translate between langs that are so different
   more abstract code smells

   maybe give answer to various code smells w/ abstractions etc.
   weakness: why these abstractions instead of OOP ones?


* code TODO:
  trackmanager
  native UI
