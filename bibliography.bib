  notes={Writing unit tests for modules/objects/etc. before modifying them is apparently a good idea},
  abstract={The maintenance of legacy code is a hard task since
                  developers do not have access to details of its
                  implementation. Thus, the refactoring of code units
                  usually generates problems in other parts of the
                  code that already had been validated. A solution to
                  this problem is to use an anticipated test design
                  methodology, where unit tests are first created to
                  each module/class/methods before their modification.
                  Thus, developers are able to ensure the correct
                  performance of functions after their refactoring.
                  This work discusses our experience in applying this
                  methodology to the Data Access Object (DAO) layer
                  refactoring of a real legacy application of a mobile
                  multinational. Our results show that this strategy
                  assists developers in better understanding the code
                  and improves the performance of unit tests since
                  they are produced by the own development team.
                  Furthermore, we show the importance of the miniworld
                  definition, which tries to represent a set of data
                  that increases the coverage of the test process.}
