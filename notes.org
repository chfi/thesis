* Notes
Ignore Cy.js in report?
After all, it's more or less superfluous;
the interesting parts may be connecting BD to other data, that's it.


* Transformations
** Bio data

** Events between components
Untyped but "structurally safe";
practically typesafe since it's in Maybe/(Either String)

** UI/DOM
Not (yet) directly applicable to my code, but interesting nonetheless:

** User stats
User stats = annotating and saving each UI interaction,
in other words (more or less):

#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
type Stats = WriterT StatsLog UIMonad a
#+END_SRC

Adding this is a good example of extending an existing application with something real
